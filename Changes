          between commits (and no need to cache the repositories)
        - moved pod tests to the release stage
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - fix small errors in the ascii-art graphs
        - improve inter-documentation linkage by using L<> instead of C<>
        [PACKAGING]

0.08 Mon Dec 17 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - made a number of tests more robust

0.07 Sat Jan  3 06:35:52 CET 2009
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - moved the stitching algorithm in its own module:
          Git::Fast:Export::Stitch
        - git-stitch-repo is now a thin wrapper around it
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - the stitching algorithm is documented in Git::FastExport::Stitch
        - the use cases are documented in git-stitch-repo
        [TESTS]
        - fixed the test repositories code
        - added tests involving stitching 3-way merges

0.06 Sat Dec 20 00:07:44 CET 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - git-stitch-repo: greatly improved the algorithm for finding
          a suitable commit to attach to, avoiding inconsistencies:
          git-stitch-repo can now stitch non-linear repositories
          in a consistent way
        - git-stitch-repo: added an option to change the attachment
          commit selection algorithm
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - documentation improvements on git-stitch-repo, with a lot
          more ascii graphs

0.05 Sun Oct  5 01:22:53 CEST 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - made Git::FastExport::Block an independent module
        [TESTS]
        - t/30stitch-repo.t now caches the source repositories used in
          the tests. This speed up considerably this test script after
          the first run (from 2 minutes to 2 seconds)

0.04 Wed Aug 20 22:04:30 CEST 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - git-stitch-repo: fixed a bug that caused many commits/branches
          to be lost because different branches were given the same name.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - improved documentation for git-stitch-repo
        [TESTS]
        - t/30stitch-repot.t actually tests the results of running
          git-stitch-repo on several different configurations

0.03 Mon Jul  7 19:29:23 CEST 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - git-stitch-repo: fixed a segmentation fault that occured
          at program destruction, because of a huge self-referential
          hash of hashes

0.02 Fri Jul  4 11:03:54 CEST 2008
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - added a README file
        - added documentation for git-stitch-repo
        [TESTS]
        - added t/00load.t and t/01new.t to increase test coverage

0.01 Thu Jun 26 14:00:01 CEST 2008
        [FEATURES]
        - process git-fast-export output
        - uses the Git.pm module provided with git
        [SCRIPTS]
        - git-stitch-repo can "stitch" together two unrelated repositories
