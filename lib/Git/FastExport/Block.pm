=head1 NAME

Git::FastExport::Block - A block in a fast-export stream

=head1 SYNOSPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Git::FastExport::Block> represents blocks from a B<git-fast-export>
stream.

Internally, it is a simple hash with keys pointing either to a string
or a reference to an array of strings, which makes it very
easing to edit (when obtained via C<Git::FastExport> C<next_block()>
method) or create.

The following two keys are pointing to strings:

=over 4

=item *

header

first line of the block

=item *

data

content of the block data section

=back

All the other keys are pointing to references to arrays of strings
(each string representing a line in the B<fast-export> stream:

=over 4

=item *

mark

=item *

author

=item *

commiter

=item *

from

=item *

merge

=item *

files

=item *

tagger

=back

Of course, which keys are present depend on the type of the block, 
which is conveniently stored in the C<type> key.

=head1 METHODS

A C<Git::FastExport::Block> structure is meant to be used as a hash,
and is not protected by an accessor/mutator interface.

However, the module provides a method for ouputing blocks:

=over 4

=item as_string()

Return the block as a string suitable for B<git-fast-import>.
